This will be an unofficial LaTeX Beamer theme for the London School of Economics.

Current Version: 0.1

Based on: BerlinFU theme (http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/w/Mi/BeamerTemplateCorporateDesign) and Seth Brown's bunsen theme (http://www.drbunsen.org/home/2011/11/2/designing-a-custom-beamer-template-theme-for-presentations.html). 

I recommend using the BerlinFU color and font themes. Please download these from the BerlinFU Beamer Template website.

Please see the Example.pdf and Example.tex to get an idea of what the theme looks like.
